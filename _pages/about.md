I'm a cognitive neuroscientist and neuroethicist. Currently, I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the [Kavli Center for Ethics, Science, and the Public](https://kavlicenter.berkeley.edu/people) at UC Berkeley. Previously, I was a postdoc in the [Lab of Edward Chang](https://changlab.ucsf.edu/) within the Department of Neurological Surgery at UCSF.

As a cognitive neuroscientist, my research seeks a mechanistic account of how the human brain enables *music perception* - a hallmark of human culture. Such insight informs our understanding of the brain and has the power to drive music-based interventions for treating neurological disorders. To do this work, I combine computational modeling, machine learning, and human neural measurements at different spatial scales using ECoG, MEG, and EEG.

As a neuroethicist, I write about emerging brain-computer interfaces that decode auditory or motor representations. My goal is to inform broad audiences of the relevant neurobiological underpinnings so that, as a society, we can separate existential privacy fears (often the result of "neurohype") from the potential these technologies hold to address current inequities, particularly for people with communication or mobility impairments.
